## hypothesis testing
A statistical hypothesis, sometimes called confirmatory data analysis, is a hypothesis that is testable on the basis of observing a process that is modeled via a set of random variables.  
A **statistical hypothesis test** is a method of **statistical inference**.   
Commonly, two statistical data sets are compared, or a data set obtained by sampling is compared against a synthetic data set from an idealized model.   
An alternative hypothesis is proposed for the statistical-relationship between the two data-sets, and is compared to an idealized **null hypothesis** that proposes no relationship between these two data-sets. This comparison is deemed statistically significant if the relationship between the data-sets would be an unlikely realization of the null hypothesis according to a threshold probability—the significance level.   
Hypothesis tests are used when determining what outcomes of a study would lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis for a pre-specified level of significance.

假设检验是推论统计中用于检验统计假设的一种方法。  
而“统计假设”是可通过观察一组随机变量的模型进行检验的科学假说。一旦能估计未知参数，就会希望根据结果对未知的真正参数值做出适当的推论。

假设检验是统计学中必不可少的过程。假设检验评估关于总体的两个相互排斥的陈述，以确定样本数据最佳支持哪个陈述。
